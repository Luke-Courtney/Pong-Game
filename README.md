[Y2S1] 2D Game Development - Assignment 1: Pong

As part of Assignment 1 in 2D Game Development, we were tasked with taking an existing pong game and improving it. I did this by turning the bare-bones game that initally featured one paddle and a ball, into a game of brick breaker. The main challenge of this was creating a system for the ball to collide with the bricks, and bounce off in the right direction.
